## Project Overview

The **Sales Analysis** project aims to analyze and derive insights from pizza sales data to assist in business decision-making. By processing the raw data and calculating various metrics, the project helps understand overall sales performance, customer preferences, and trends. The analysis is based on the provided `DashBoard.xlsx` dataset, and it uses SQL queries to extract and compute meaningful statistics.

## Files Included

- **PIZZA SALES REPORT.docx**: This document contains a detailed report of the findings from the data analysis, including key metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and the most and least popular pizzas.
- **DashBoard.xlsx**: This file contains the raw pizza sales data, which includes details about each order, such as order date, order time, pizza category, pizza size, quantity sold, and total price.

## Work Done

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
The raw data was first cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency. Key steps included:
- Standardizing the `order_date` format to make it compatible with SQL queries.
- Converting `order_time` from text to a proper time format to allow for accurate hourly analysis.
- Removing any inconsistencies or incomplete records from the dataset to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.

### Data Analysis
Once the data was cleaned, the following metrics were computed:
1. **Total Revenue**: The total sales revenue from all orders in the dataset.
2. **Average Order Value**: The average amount spent per order, providing insight into customer spending behavior.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold**: The total number of pizzas sold, giving a sense of overall product demand.
4. **Total Orders**: The number of distinct customer orders, which reflects customer engagement.
5. **Average Pizzas per Order**: This metric measures how many pizzas customers are ordering on average per transaction.

### Time-based Analysis
The dataset was segmented by time to identify trends:
- **Day-wise Orders**: The number of orders placed on each day of the week was calculated to determine peak days for pizza sales.
- **Orders by Hour**: The distribution of orders by hour was analyzed to understand the busiest times for pizza orders.

### Sales Distribution
The analysis further broke down sales by different product categories:
- **Sales by Pizza Category**: The total revenue generated by each pizza category (e.g., Meat, Veg) was calculated, highlighting which categories contribute most to total sales.
- **Sales by Pizza Size**: A breakdown of total sales revenue and quantity sold by pizza size (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
  
### Product Performance
The performance of individual pizzas was assessed:
- **Top 5 Pizzas Sold**: The five most popular pizzas, based on the quantity sold, were identified.
- **Bottom 5 Pizzas Sold**: The five least popular pizzas, based on the quantity sold, were determined.

## Results

The analysis produced several key insights:

1. **Total Revenue**: The total sales revenue for the dataset was calculated, providing an overview of the businessâ€™s financial performance.
2. **Average Order Value**: The average amount spent by each customer per order, helping identify trends in customer spending.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold**: The total quantity of pizzas sold, which reflects the overall product demand.
4. **Total Orders**: The number of unique customer orders, offering insights into customer engagement.
5. **Average Pizzas per Order**: The average number of pizzas ordered per customer transaction, which provides insight into customer behavior and order preferences.
6. **Sales by Day and Hour**: 
   - The analysis identified which days of the week and which hours of the day had the highest number of orders, allowing the business to understand peak sales periods.
7. **Sales by Pizza Category and Size**: 
   - The sales distribution showed which pizza categories (e.g., Meat, Veg) and sizes (e.g., Small, Medium) were most popular, enabling the business to focus on high-demand products.
8. **Top 5 and Bottom 5 Pizzas Sold**: 
   - The top five pizzas that were sold the most were identified, as well as the bottom five least sold pizzas, offering valuable information about customer preferences and helping in menu optimization.
